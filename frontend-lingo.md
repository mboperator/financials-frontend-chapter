# Frontend Vernacular

> by: &lt;YOUR NAME HERE&gt;

## WIP

## Things we need to define
- [ ] handler
  - Where the rubber meets the road (rails?)
  - The App/Experience being mounted
  - May or may not receives props from Rails and Redux
  - The logical starting point for development
  - They are NOT containers (in the Redux definition of the word)

- [ ] module
  - The file formerly known as duck
  - It contains, the reducer, the action creators, and constants
  - And optionally selectors, utils
  - Or alternatively the `createModule` and its supporting functions
  - Should be more or less platform agnostic

- [ ] module middleware
- [ ] bootstrap
- [ ] connect / connectModule
- [ ] bundle
- [ ] `components.js`

## Things we want to link to
- [ ] redux-loop
- [ ] redux-saga
- [ ] redux-thunk
- [ ] redux-modules
- [ ] ramda / compose
- [ ] immutablejs

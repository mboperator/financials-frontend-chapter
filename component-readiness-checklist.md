# The Component Readiness Checklist

> by: The FF Chapter

## Our Mission
We want our components to be performant ğŸš€, easy to implement ğŸ‘“, and  internally consistent ğŸ’ª.

## Container Components
- [ ] ğŸ‘“ PropTypes are filled out
- [ ] ğŸš€ shouldComponentUpdate is implemented
- [ ] ğŸš€ Values derived from props should be calculated in selector if possible

## Presentational Components
- [ ] ğŸ‘“ PropTypes are filled out
- [ ] ğŸš€ shouldComponentUpdate is implemented
- [ ] ğŸ‘“ Props are clearly defined (not spread everywhere)

## Modules
- [ ] ğŸ’ª Data deserialization is happening in the middleware

## Selectors
- [ ] ğŸš€ toJS is avoided, or being used in its own selector
